#+STARTUP: showall

** TODO Optimizer:
*** DONE Path Triangulation.
*** DONE Return paths.
*** DONE Level Paths.
*** DONE Remove Point Duplicates.
*** DONE Extend vertical paths.
*** DONE Add Action Coordinates for pick and drop.
*** DONE Plugin to server.
*** DONE Make path avoid both top and bottom of box.
*** TODO Pick location lip height height: Vivian: "just use box height."
*** TODO Handle errors and default to standard or ensure there are no errors.
*** TODO UI Button toggle. 
*** DONE Use Line class.
*** DONE Top and bottom of box constraint.
*** TODO Clean up code and reduce total number of loops for speed.
*** TODO Enfore loop convergence on constraint solver (default to square path.)

** TODO Machine Configuration:
*** TODO Allow extra drive for V2. 

** DONE Pallet Configuration:
*** DONE θ coordinate must be numerical.

** TODO Layout Generator:
*** DONE Row Column-Fill (Version 1)
*** TODO Distance Optimization.
*** TODO Extend algorithmn to rotate boxes to fit more in.

** TODO TeachMode:
*** DONE Compute rotation of pallet relative to box. (may not be relevant anymore.)
*** TODO Jogger Rotation Display.
*** TODO IO/Jog controller safety on use before initialization in subcomponents.
*** TODO Limit Stack Height.
*** TODO Something about setting box orientation.
*** TODO Add good pick detection in teach mode.
*** DONE θ coordinate numerical
*** DONE Round coordinates in the jogger.
*** TODO Update jogger to use numberical rotation (UI piece for this as well.) Right now it is a boolean that probably doesnt work.

** DONE mm-js-api:
*** DONE Use position from step counts. (Gain computation.) -- This is crucial for not causing giving strang positions when user jogs past end stops.

** TODO Execution:
*** TODO Add toggle for path optimization.

** TODO Production:
*** TODO Logging.
*** TODO Update protocol -- git?

** TODO Engine:
*** TODO Add Good Pick Detection + Box Detection Actions.
*** TODO Consistent error messaging to client. (see: catch blocks and information send)

** TODO Configuration Page:
*** TODO Reload configs on create (so that they show up immediately).
*** TODO Default to configuration page when there are no configurations.

** TODO Visualizer:
*** DONE Visualizer: Frame + coordinates + axes 
*** DONE Visualizer -- drop locations in order.
*** DONE Visualizer -- partial rotations of pallet + boxe
*** TODO Test multiple pallets.

** TODO Vivian Requests:
*** TODO Add a "go to taught position" button for validation ?? Where should this button go?
*** TODO There should be a pure jogger screen (not needing to go to pallet config or machine config ?? What machine do I use then?
*** TODO Layer configuration is tough to use (snapping with overlaps). Need better control of the boxes location too
*** TODO There should be labelled "x and y and z" in every image. With proper orientations
*** TODO Offset user interface needed to be added
*** TODO Path optimization needs to be fixed ?? Can I get a real configuration.
*** DONE There should be a home axes screen in the pallet configuration. Step 3 should not show unless homed first
*** TODO There should be homing buttons in the home page ?? Ah, okay.
*** TODO There should be a system speed and acceleration ?? Will do by drive.
*** DONE Checkbox for gearbox or custom gain in the actuator set up
*** DONE Rename "select" to "save"
*** DONE populate columns and rows instead of dragging and dropping boxes
*** TODO joggers (teach positions) had too large of a "click-space" where a user could accidentally click it
*** TODO Should not refresh configuration page before other set ups are shown
*** DONE Missing delete layer
*** TODO Missing software stop in palletizer app ?? check detection mechanism.
*** DONE incomplete config (edited) 

** TODO General: 
*** TODO Name & complete are duplicated within raw_json. This is a hack around passing data from Configuration -> Teach/Machine_Config, fix later.
