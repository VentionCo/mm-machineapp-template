* Palletizer
** TODO Teach Mode 
   - Compute rotational angle of pallet. 
** TODO Visualizer
   - Handle multiple pallets
   - Deal with the strange offset on pallet configuration 2 (locally)
   - Update to deal with optimized coordinates.
   - Deal with new coordinate format.
** TODO Execution Control
   - Toggle optimization, optimization errors -- which shouldn't exist for valid pallet configuration.
** TODO Path Otimization
   - Add lip height to pick point configuration.
   - Appropriate location for optimizations.
   - Triangulation about lip height.
** TODO Machine Configuration
   - Allow extra drive for V2. 
** DONE Pallet Configuration
   -Î¸ coordinate must be numerical
** TODO Layout Generator
   - Implement UI of v1 prototype. Figure out which inputs are necessary.
** TODO Production
   - Implement logging.
   - Proper deploy instructions.
** TODO Engine
   - Implement action path throughout.
   - Detection action at path segement.
   


** TODO Live updating capabilities (from Git? -- this would be quite useful in prod.)
