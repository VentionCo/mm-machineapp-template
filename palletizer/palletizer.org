PALLETIZER -*- mode: org -*-
#+STARTUP: showall


* Palletizer
** Visualizer
   - Handle multiple pallets
   - Deal with the strange offset on pallet configuration 2 (locally)
** Path Otimization
   - Add lip height to pick point configuration.
   - Appropriate location for optimizations.
   - Triangulation about lip height.
** Machine Configuration
   - Allow extra drive for V2. 
** Pallet Configuration
   - Rotation should become a coordinate / not boolean -- drive must be rotary actuator with degree coordinates.
** Layout Generator
   - Implement UI of v1 prototype. Figure out which inputs are necessary.
** Production
   - Implement logging.
   - Proper deploy instructions.
   - Integration with existing server.
